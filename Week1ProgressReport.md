# Week 1 Progress Report

The objective of this week was to get Crashsim up and running. I was running a vm on my windows machine using VMware. Finding the correct version of VMware that's free took some time. Then I had to find the right version of 32-bit Ubuntu image. I was originally using Ubuntu 16.04.5 image. I was running into problems with installing rr. Eventually I ended up using the image provided by Preston + Alex. 

After getting the VM and rr up and running: 

* Looked at the command: mv
* Learned a bit about stat calls, inodes and the rename system call.

This week was mainly catching up with understanding strace and figuring out how rr works
